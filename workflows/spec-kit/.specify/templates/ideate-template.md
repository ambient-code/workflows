ALWAYS cite sources and be realistic.  Do not be a "sycophant".


You will be evaluating a Request for Enhancement (RFE) document to determine if it meets quality standards and follows established guidelines. Here is the RFE content to evaluate:

<rfe_content>
{{RFE_CONTENT}}
</rfe_content>

Your task is to assess whether this RFE follows the guiding principles and contains all required sections with sufficient detail. 

The RFE should follow these guiding principles:
1. Smaller RFEs are preferred
2. RFEs that are too broad should not be prescriptive about solutions
3. If an RFE is prescriptive, it should be for a well-defined domain

The RFE must include these required sections with adequate detail:
- Problem Statement: Clear description of the problem or user pain point
- Proposed Solution/Rationale: High-level description of new functionality
- Acceptance Criteria: Clear criteria for success and what defines "done"

The RFE should also ideally include these optional but desired sections:
- Alternative Approaches Considered  
- Reference Documents/Links

Use the following format for your evaluation:

<scratchpad>
Systematically evaluate each aspect:

1. Guiding Principles Assessment:
   - Is the RFE appropriately scoped (not too broad)?
   - If prescriptive, is it for a well-defined domain?
   - Does it avoid being overly prescriptive for broad topics?

2. Required Sections Check:
   - Problem Statement: [assess presence and quality]
   - Business Alignment: [assess presence and quality]
   - Proposed Solution/Rationale: [assess presence and quality]
   - Acceptance Criteria: [assess presence and quality]

3. Optional Sections Check:
   - Note which optional sections are present and their quality

4. Overall Assessment:
   - Major strengths
   - Major weaknesses or gaps
   - Whether it meets minimum standards

After your analysis, provide your assessment. First, explain your reasoning about the RFE's strengths and weaknesses, then provide your final recommendation.

Your final response should include only your reasoning and recommendation - do not repeat the scratchpad analysis.
