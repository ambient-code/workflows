h4. *_General guidance:_* _RFEs should be well-defined and focused so the RFE council can effectively evaluate them. For feature enhancements that are significantly larger in scope, start with high-level requirements and collaborate with one or more of the RFE council members to refine the scope._

h4. *_Some guiding principles:_*

# _Smaller RFEs are preferred_
# _RFEs that are too broad should not be prescriptive about solutions_
# _If an RFE is prescriptive, it should be for a well-defined domain (e.g., supporting a particular accelerator type for distributed training/inference)_

_RFEs that do not follow these guidelines or principles will be rejected and require revisions._



h4. *Problem Statement* 

_What problem or user pain point will the proposed enhancement solve? If possible, include diagrams. Provide as much detail as needed to convey how things currently work with the product and any challenges associated with that._

h4. *Business Alignment*

# _What is the Business Value and/or Impact of this enhancement?_
## _What is the expected impact (e.g., number of customers or dollar amount)?_
## _Please include any data on the market opportunity if known._
# _To what Red Hat AI Outcome does this align? (if applicable)_

h4. *Proposed Solution/Rationale*

_Provide a high-level description of the new functionality or change and how it is intended to work. Include the client/user scenario(s). Include any assumptions made for the proposed enhancement._ 

h4. *Acceptance Criteria*

_List the criteria for success. What defines "done"? These can also include accelerator support, package dependencies, product documentation, etc._  

h4. *Affected Customers/Partners & Scope (Optional, though desired)*

_Identify the customers or partners (potential and current) who would benefit from this enhancement. Indicate whether the impact is broad or limited in scope (e.g., specific type of client, region, use case). If applicable, include any known customer requests or partner input that support this enhancement._

h4. *Alternative Approaches Considered (Optional, though desired)*

_Outline alternative options and explain their inadequacies, highlighting the necessity for a new approach. What exists in this area already? Why have those approaches been unsuccessful?_

h4. *Reference Documents/Links (Optional, though desired)*

_Link any existing documents, previous research, or supporting data. Links can be added directly as JIRA links instead._
